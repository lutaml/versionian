= Version Schemes

== Overview

Versionian supports a wide variety of versioning schemes, from well-established standards like
Semantic Versioning to specialized schemes like Calendar Versioning and SoloVer. This section

----
# Get a built-in scheme
scheme = Versionian.get_scheme(:semantic)

# Parse a version string
version = scheme.parse("1.12.0")

# Compare two versions
result = scheme.compare("1.12.0", "2.0.0")  # => -1

# Build a version programmatically
version = scheme.build(major: 1, minor: 12, patch: 0)
